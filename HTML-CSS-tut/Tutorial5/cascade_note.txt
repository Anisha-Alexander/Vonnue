It is usually to pour downwards
when it comes to css the rules cascading from top to bottom
ie, css properties flowing down from parents to children and it encompasses really two different concepts "inheritance" and "specificity" 
html elements can inherit css rules that are applied to their parent elements
child elements inherit properties from parent element but not all properties are inherited, things like margin, padding, background styles and border are not inherited. Its mainly font , text styles and colors are inherited!
